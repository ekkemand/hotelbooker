# Hotel Booker

## Description
This is the repository of my school project, called Hotel Booker. Each student had to choose their own individual topic of the web application and I chose to build an app in which the users can easily book a hotel room of their own choice, review the hotel and the room based on their experience and categorize it with a really short description, so that people can filter hotels by the categories of the reviews.

Only the administrators of the page can create and edit the info of the hotels, accept review categories to be listed in filters and even delete information, including user posted info - they can do everything on the page. Only the administrators can grant/deny the users administrator rights.  

A registered user can only edit its own posted information, nobody else's.
